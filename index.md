Join us for another Arm Scalable Vector Extension Hackathon!  This hands-on, non-NDA event will introduce vector length agnostic programming and jumpstart developers targeting the the first CPU to implement SVE, the Fujitsu A64FX.  Hands-on exercises will introduce SVE compilers, libraries, and tools from Fujitsu, Cray, Arm, and GNU, and show how popular HPC codes can take advantage of SVE.

Fujitsu are supporting this event with remote access to a [Fujitsu PRIMEHPC FX700](https://www.fujitsu.com/global/products/computing/servers/supercomputer/) system.  Don't miss out!  Remote access details will be provided on the day of the event to all registered attendees.

Join us for another Arm Scalable Vector Extension Hackathon!  This hands-on, non-NDA event will introduce vector length agnostic programming and jumpstart developers targeting the the first CPU to implement SVE, the Fujitsu A64FX.  Hands-on exercises will introduce SVE compilers, libraries, and tools from Fujitsu, Cray, Arm, and GNU, and show how popular HPC codes can take advantage of SVE.  Bring your own code or use our prepared hands-on exercises!

This event is generously supported by Fujitsu and the University of Bristol.  Fujitsu will provide remote access to a [Fujitsu PRIMEHPC FX700](https://www.fujitsu.com/global/products/computing/servers/supercomputer/) system.  The University of Bristol will provide access to the [HPE Apollo 80](https://buy.hpe.com/us/en/servers/apollo-systems/apollo-80-system/apollo-80-system/hpe-apollo-80-system/p/1012970957) partition of [Isambard 2, the largest Arm-based supercomputer in Europe](https://insidehpc.com/2020/02/isambard-2-at-uk-met-office-to-be-largest-arm-supercomputer-in-europe/).  Don't miss out!  Remote access details will be provided to all registered attendees.
